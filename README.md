## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a QA engineer.

I chose QA because I like to dig into something, look for errors especially those that BA and developers could have missed.

### Roles and Responsibilities:  
- Identify Test cases for Automation.
- Developing methods for repeating steps.
- Writing scripts, executing test cases and debugging.
- Prepare automation scripts in Selenium WebDriver.
- Regression Testing, support and reviewing Test scripts.
- Data driven Test script.
